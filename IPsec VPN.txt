The IPsec consists of two security services: 
	- Authentication Header (AH), AH allows authentication of the sender
	- Encapsulating Security payload (ESP), ESP allows authentication of the sender as well as encryption of the data.

IPsec provides secure communication for network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, and ensures data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection IPsec consists of two encryption modes: transport and tunnel. 
	- In transport mode, the data portion or the payload is encrypted. 
	- In tunnel mode, the entire IP is encrypted.

Protocols used in deploying a VPN: 
	For deploying the virtual private networks, there are two primary options: IPsec and SSL. 
	Each protocol has its own unique advantages and are utilized depending on the requirement of the user or the organization’s IT processes.

	IPsec VPN:
	IPsec-based VPN is the most commonly used deployment solution by most of organizations.
	IPsec connections are established using VPN client software, which is pre-installed and mainly focuses on the company-managed desktops.

	SSL VPN (web-based):
	SSL-based VPNs provide remote-access connectivity using a web browser and its native SSL encryption, regardless of the location. SSL doesn’t require any special client software to be pre-installed and is capable of any type of connectivity.

Improving VPN Speed:
	- VPN Server Location
	- VPN Server Load
	- Reliable Provider
	- Configure Firewall Settings to Optimize VPN Speed 
	- Processor Speed 
	- Security Protocol Type
	- Choose a Stable ISP 
	- Choose a Wired Connection 
	- Choose a Proper Device

VPN Components:
	- VPN client: A computer that initiates a secure remote connection to a VPN server. 
	- Network access server (NAS): It is also called a media gateway or a remote-access server (RAS). It is responsible for setting up and maintaining each tunnel in a remote-access VPN. Users need to connect to the NAS to use a VPN.
	- Tunnel terminating device (or VPN server): A computer that accepts VPN connections from VPN clients.
	- VPN protocol: It includes VPN specific protocols used to manage tunnels and encapsulate private data. It includes the use of PPTP and L2TP protocols along with IPsec.
